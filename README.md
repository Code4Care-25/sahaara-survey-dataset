# Survey Data
Comprehensive mental health survey data collected from higher education students

We are conducting a market survey to validate the necessity of our mental health platform Sahaara. This research helps us understand student mental health challenges, identify gaps in existing campus support systems, and prioritize features that students actually need. The anonymous survey data will guide our development to ensure we build a platform that truly addresses real student concerns.
